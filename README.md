[**The Effect of Coffee and Music on People's Memory**](https://github.com/yyuqing-42/The-Effects-of-Coffee-and-Music-on-Human-s-memory-)

> R, 
> ggplot2,
> Experiment Design

My group conducted a two-way randomized block design to study the potential effects of coffee and music on human's memory. As coffee and music become increasingly common in the workplace, it is important to see how they might affect employee work performance and productivity. Many studies show the beneficial effects of caffeine on cognitive function and memory. Studies also show that music can enhance the attention and memory centers of the brain.

The results of this study may provide insight on how employers should provide employees with accommodations.
