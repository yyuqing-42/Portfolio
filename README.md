# Welcome to Yuqing's Portfolio

Hello, my name is Yuqing Yang.

I recently graduated from University of California, Los Angeles **(UCLA)** with a Bachelor of Science in **Statistics**. During my time at college, I have developed a strong analytics and problem-solving skill set that can tackle business problems.

In my portfolio below, I'd like to share some of my data science projects I completed so far. Hope you enjoy reading it!

**My group conducted a two-way randomized block design to study the potential effects of coffee and music on human's memory. As coffee and music become increasingly common in the workplace, it is important to see how they might affect employee work performance and productivity. The results of this study may provide insight on how employers should provide employees with accommodations.**

## Indeed Job Posting

**In today’s competitive labor market, sourcing the best talent is more difficult than ever. Although factors such as income, benefits, and company culture affect an applicant’s willingness to apply to a company, the job posting itself also contributes to an applicant’s willingness to apply. In order to hire the best employees, companies are pushed to improve the quality of their job postings because only the top postings will attract the top candidates. Thus, my group set out to explore some factors that will influence the popularity of a job posting in order to give companies the best advice.**
